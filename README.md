# My-first-ML-project-on-IRIS-classification
In this project, we have used a iris dataset and done an analysis based on the sepal length , sepal width, petal length and  petal width to classify according to its class. Then we have implemented 5 types of algorithm and compared those algorithm and found the best one. SVM came as the best algorithm out of these with above 96 percent accuravy
